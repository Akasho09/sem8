## Summary of the Proposed Work
- This work presents a deep learning–based framework for automated **dental enumeration** from panoramic radiographs, with a focus on producing clinically valid and anatomically consistent tooth numbering rather than only high pixel-level segmentation accuracy.
- The approach begins with pixel-level **semantic segmentation** of panoramic dental X-rays using the **FDI tooth numbering system**, where each image is annotated into 32 tooth classes. An enhanced U-Net–based architecture is trained to generate precise segmentation masks for individual teeth using a multi-channel sigmoid output and a combined Dice–Binary Cross Entropy loss to handle class imbalance and overlapping teeth.
- To address the key limitation of existing methods, which often stop at segmentation, the framework introduces a post-segmentation enumeration stage. In this stage, connected component analysis and spatial feature extraction are applied to convert segmentation masks into individual tooth instances. Anatomical constraints such as jaw separation, left–right ordering, quadrant consistency, and sequential FDI numbering are enforced to validate and correct tooth labels. Missing teeth are explicitly detected based on the absence of expected FDI classes.
