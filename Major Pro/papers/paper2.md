### ⭐ 1. Introduction
- 🔹 Problem Statement
- Dental diseases like:
    - Cavities
    - Periodontal disease
    - Periapical infections
- are major global health problems and can lead to:
    - Pain
    - Tooth loss
    - Systemic diseases
- Traditional diagnosis:
    - Done manually by dentists
    - Time-consuming
    - Subjective
    - Error-prone

### 🔹 Research Contribution
- The paper proposes a Hybrid Deep Learning Framework combining:
    - HOG (Handcrafted features)
    - DenseNet-201 (CNN)
    - Swin Transformer
    - LSTM classifier

### ⭐ 2. Literature Review
- 🔹 Previous Approaches
- Earlier studies used:
    - CNN models
    - Transformer models
    - Segmentation models
    - Ensemble learning models
- These achieved good accuracy but had limitations


### ⭐ 3. Framework Architecture & Methodology
- 🔹 Dataset Used (DRAD Dataset)
    - 1272 dental X-ray images
- Includes:
    - Cavities
    - Implants
    - Fillings
    - Impacted teeth
- Dataset Split:
    - Training → 37.5%
    - Testing → 30.8%
    - Validation → 31.8%

> Whether a tooth or region in an X-ray is healthy or diseased, and identifies the type of dental disorder.
- Cavities
- Implants
- Fillings
- Impacted
